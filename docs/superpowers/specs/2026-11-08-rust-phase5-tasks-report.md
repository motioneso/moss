# Rust Phase 5 Tasks — shared host checkpoint

Task JS-46, Card 522. Part of #4027. Work is in the task's own checkout of
`~/Jarv1s`. This report currently covers the shared prerequisite requested by the
coordinator. **The Tasks module has not been ported in this checkpoint.**
The coordinator subsequently approved stopping JS-46 at this shared PR and
creating a separate Tasks continuation from the remaining-work list below.

## What this checkpoint adds

Package builders can use pure Rust host contracts, bounded typed queries with a
transaction per invocation, parameterized routes, host-supplied actor/time/UUID
values, an optional adapter assembly seam, verified opaque package screens and a
small shared Leptos kit with a parent bridge. Existing entry points remain
available. The coordinator authorized these shared extensions and requested an
early separate PR so People and Notes can build on main.

Each extension has a separate commit. The compile compatibility fix repairs the
Phase 4b host's use of the existing Vault API through an additive constructor.
No Tasks SQL, screens, tools or job kinds are replaced here. The host does not
open arbitrary account folders; that adapter belongs to the Notes builder.
See `rust-spike/module-host/EXTENDED_HOST.md` for contracts and limits.

| Database deadlines            | Missing bounded constructor prevented the saturated-pool test from compiling     | Opt-in deadlines cover pool wait, transaction setup, queries and completion; real gate checks pool exhaustion and the next actor |

The bridge control was run after authoring its implementation; it is a real
guard-removal failure, not a claim of a pre-implementation browser failure.
Compile failures establish absent APIs, not behavioral privacy evidence.

## What was exercised

The database gate drives actual Wasmtime host imports against a throwaway
PostgreSQL database. It covers composite assignment keys, owner-only preference
keys, another account and an instance admin being unable to read or mutate the
owner's rows, forged assignment refusal, and rollback after a guest error, trap,
unsuccessful route status or SQL failure caught by the guest. Reusing an external
request ID does not reuse a transaction. Removing RLS makes the same cross-account
read see the protected row; restoring it hides the row again.

The live browser fixture installs a signed sample package and serves it through
the real frame API. Clicking its button writes through the parent bridge,
Wasmtime and account-scoped KV, then displays “Saved through the Rust module
host.” The screenshot is a real capture of that fixture. It uses a temporary
sample account and is explicitly labeled as a shared-frame check.

Validation includes the native host suite, strict host/SDK/UI clippy, SDK tests,
UI SSR markup and browser-Wasm compilation, Node bridge tests, repository lint,
format, type and file-size checks, and real database gates. The proof artifact and
PR carry their final outcomes and review findings. Screenshots, generated assets
and local logs stay out of git.

The real transaction gate first passed in the run ending `000724-dXFlbv`; the
assembly extension passed in the run ending `002529-SANMdr`. The new deadline
control and final merged-base checks are part of the final verification, not a
claim that those earlier receipts tested later code.

## Not proven and remaining work

- No Tasks package, production component ABI binding or Tasks parity harness run.
- No Tasks app-map declaration, screens, chat tools, queue consumers or People API
  integration yet. The shared APIs do not add an app-map destination by themselves.
- No authenticated Moss shell integration, sign-in, HTTPS, trusted-origin browser
  check or access from a second device in this checkpoint.
- The initial Leptos kit covers five components, not the full UI catalogue.
- File compensation is not distributed atomicity. Adapters must detect conflicting
  later edits and retain recoverable receipts rather than overwrite someone else.

The continuation is to build `modules/tasks/` against the merged shared host;
reuse original SQL bytes/ledgers and owner-only RLS; port the exact existing
routes, tools, jobs and screens; link People only through declared public APIs;
update package app-map metadata; run failing-first Tasks privacy and parity
checks; and exercise the authenticated Rust UI from a second device before
claiming full Tasks parity. Workshop and Food remain excluded.

## Independent review corrections and follow-up

Round one found two major issues: navigation could reuse the frame bridge, and
the plan failed formatting. A new public bridge test first reproduced the extra
host call after a frame load. Commands now use a single document-bound transferred port; later bootstrap
messages are ignored, and later loads revoke it. The fixture attaches before
assigning its verified URL, and the guest bootstraps during initial startup. Repository lint also
caught missing browser globals and control-character regexes; these are corrected.
The fixture now omits a GET body.

The remaining minor findings are accepted as documented limits, not merge gates:
mutation filters can be broad/tautological; mutation results have no row cap;
external side effects and nested calls are outside the typed transaction; failed
calls discard connections; cancellation during BEGIN/COMMIT lacks direct tests;
malformed non-ui screen entries fail only during serving; and encoded literal
routes can resolve differently from canonical paths. `EXTENDED_HOST.md` describes
each limitation for downstream builders. No finding was rejected to end review.
