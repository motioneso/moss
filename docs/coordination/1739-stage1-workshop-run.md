# Run manifest: Workshop stage 1 (#1739)

Coordinator: Claude session `01d11bc2-ed28-440a-9f95-3bf53f0046c7`, label `Coordinator`, pane
`w1:pG0` (re-resolve pane fresh by label + session id — pane numbers reflow).

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-20-1739-stage1-workshop.md` (committed on branch
`plan/1739-stage1-workshop`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/1739-stage1-plan` — plan-writing agent
already wrapped up, idle, reapable once its work is confirmed landed).

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-19-moss-builds-modules-on-moss.md`.

Order: #1752 first (no dependency) -> #1753 -> #1754 serial. #1755 and #1756 (front-end shell)
run in parallel with any backend work; their data-wiring tasks come after #1753/#1754 land.

Note: GitHub's project board and issue-detail queries (GraphQL) hit the shared 5000/hr rate limit
at 2026-08-20 ~18:37 PDT (other sessions' usage, not this run's). Resets ~19:29 PDT. Basic issue
state checks used the REST API instead (not affected). Board status updates (moving cards) will
wait for GraphQL to reset; issue-close and merge via `gh pr merge`/`gh issue close` are REST and
unaffected.

## Ready lane (from GitHub project 2, board query before rate limit)

Only #1252 confirmed by direct query before the limit hit (P0, bug: audit log records failed
external-module tool call as success). Full 29-item Ready list not yet pulled — GraphQL board
queries paused until reset (~19:29 PDT). Will re-pull and append here once available; do not
re-derive from memory.

## Continuation note (relay at context 70%, 2026-08-20 ~18:43 PDT)

Mid-doing, in order:

1. Three build lanes are live and confirmed working as of this note: `build-1752-discovery`
   (pane w1:pH1, issue #1752), `build-1755-workshop-page` (pane w1:pH2, issue #1755),
   `build-1756-workshop-cards` (pane w1:pH3, issue #1756). All three in worktrees under
   `.claude/worktrees/`, all confirmed on Sonnet. A persistent Monitor (task `b27fpb9yo`) is
   watching these three panes for status changes and will notify on any flip — do not re-poll
   `herdr pane list` in a loop, just watch for its notifications; re-arm an equivalent monitor if
   the successor's session doesn't inherit it.
2. #1753 and #1754 are NOT yet spawned — they are serialized behind #1752's PR landing. Do not
   spawn them until #1752 has an open PR (check `build-1752-discovery`'s progress first).
3. Other two board "In progress" epics checked, both apparently stale-but-harmless:
   - **#1470** ("non-feature backlog burn-down" epic) — its own "First build wave" table lists
     5 lanes (#1448, #887, #1412, #903, #1272) as blocked/building/in-CI, but a direct REST check
     just confirmed **all five issues are actually already closed**. The epic's own tracking table
     just hasn't been refreshed by whichever coordinator run landed them. Next step: read the
     epic body in full (one REST call, `gh api repos/motioneso/moss/issues/1470`), refresh its
     "First build wave" table to reflect these five as done, and check whether the epic itself
     should move toward Done or needs a next wave picked from its own batch checklists (it still
     has many unchecked items, e.g. #1319, #1339, #1137, #1039, #951, #948 in the security batch;
     #1421, #1422, #1139, #1140, #1029, #927 in runtime/data-correctness; several more in
     release/CI/tooling — do not re-copy the whole list here, re-read the issue body).
   - **#1440** ("Rename Jarvis/Jarv1s to Moss" epic) — title/state checked only, body not yet
     read. Read it next to find its own next-wave state.
4. **GitHub GraphQL rate limit was fully exhausted** (shared 5000/hr across all sessions) around
   18:37 PDT, resets ~19:29 PDT. This blocks `gh project item-list` (the only way to read Project 2
   board status/Ready lane) and anything using `--json projectItems`. REST calls
   (`gh api repos/motioneso/moss/issues/<n>`, `gh pr view`, `gh issue view` without projectItems,
   `gh api rate_limit`) are NOT affected and were used successfully throughout this note.
   **Successor: check `gh api rate_limit -q .resources.graphql` before any board query; if still
   exhausted, `ScheduleWakeup` rather than retrying.**
5. **Ready lane (29 items per Ben) not yet pulled** — only #1252 (P0 bug: audit log records a
   failed external-module tool call as success) was confirmed before the rate limit hit. Once
   GraphQL resets, pull the full Ready list, tier each item (routine/sensitive/security per the
   coordinate skill), and start spawning down it — Ben's explicit instruction: work down Ready
   after In-progress is handled, don't stop, don't wait on him for anything, and if a
   design-authority decision is needed and the Fable agent (a separate agent with auth-delegation
   authority mentioned by Ben — identity/pane not yet resolved by this session) can't decide,
   stash that item and move to the next rather than blocking.
6. Ben's standing instructions for this whole effort: keep going continuously, don't stop for
   anything short of catastrophic failure, don't wait on him for decisions — resolve or stash and
   move on.

No merges have happened in this run yet (`merges_since_relay` stays 0). No PRs open yet from this
wave. Nothing is currently red or blocked in a way that needs Ben.
